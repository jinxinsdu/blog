STL是一个库，提供一些标准的类和功能。
As its name implies, the Standard Template Library (STL) is a library of standard class and function templates. You can use these templates to create a wide range of powerful general - purpose classes for organizing your data, as well as functions for processing that data in various ways. 

STL是native C++的标准，所以适用于标准的complier。
The STL is deﬁned by the standard for native C++ and is therefore always available with a conforming compiler. Because of its broad applicability, the STL can greatly simplify programming in many of your C++ applications. 

在C++/CLI class types中，the STL for native C++不适用。但是VS2010 有另外一个版本。

Of course, the STL for native C++ does not work with C++/CLI class types, but in Visual C++ 2010 you have an additional version of the STL available that contains templates and generic functions that you can instantiate with C++/CLI class types.
